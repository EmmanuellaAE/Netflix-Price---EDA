# Netflix-Price---EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Prices of Netflix Subscriptions in 65 different countries.
Note that Netflix is available in over 190 countries.
There is only one African country in this data set: South Africa.
I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle.
This is a personal project. 
I loaded the data set, observed it closely and found that the only changes needed were the column names.
I renamed the columns to make them easier to use and I analysed the data.
Visualized and wrote down some of my observations.
loaded a 2nd data set to help explore the data more.
